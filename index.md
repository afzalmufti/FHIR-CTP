# Introduction #

## Background ##

This Clinical Decision Support (CDS) RESTful FHIR STU3 ‘Read Only’ experimental API implementation guide supports the initiatives set out by the UEC Digital Integration Programme.

The UEC Digital Integration Programme supports the delivery of the key recommendations and drivers for change that resulted from a number of NHS strategies, policies, frameworks and reviews, including the National Information Board (NIB) Health and Care 2020 framework, 
the Urgent and Emergency Care Review, and the Five Year Forward View. To achieve the transformation of Urgent and Emergency Care, patients must be directed to or connected with the right service to meet their needs and not be sent or conveyed to high end dispositions 
such as Accident and Emergency or GPs, unless absolutely necessary.  

## In Scope ##
This guide covers triage of patients by non-clinical staff and triage of patients by clinicians. This guide is intended for use by developers who are making systems compliant with the guide.

## Out of Scope ##
The following technical area is specifically excluded:
* Assurance and system accreditation

*Note that the process by which a user can amend the outcome from CDSS is not part of the CDSS specification, but is left with the EMS.*
