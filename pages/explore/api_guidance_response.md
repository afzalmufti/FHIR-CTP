## GuidanceResponse Interaction##
The `GuidanceResponse` is the primary message generated by the Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS).  It is returned by the CDSS in response to the EMS's `ServiceDefinition` $evaluate operation.  
It provides a container for the status of the response, any warnings or messages returned by the service, as well as the output data of the module and any suggested actions to be performed.

## Request Headers ##
The following HTTP request headers are supported for this interaction:  


| Header               | Value |Conformance |
|----------------------|-------|-------|
| `Accept`      | The `Accept` header indicates the format of the response the client is able to understand, this will be one of the following <code class="highlighter-rouge">application/fhir+json</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">application/fhir+xml</code>. See the RESTful API [Content types](api_general_guidance.html#content-types) section. | MAY |
| `Authorization`      | <!--The `Authorization` header will carry the base64url encoded JSON web token required for audit on the spine - see [Access Tokens and Audit (JWT)](integration_access_tokens_and_audit_JWT.html) for details.-->Placeholder |  <!--MUST-->Placeholder |
| `fromASID`           | <!--Client System ASID-->Placeholder | <!--MUST-->Placeholder |
| `toASID`             | <!--The Spine ASID-->Placeholder | <!--MUST-->Placeholder |


This resource has the following elements of note:  

### Status ###
The status of the `GuidanceResponse` is a trigger for the Encounter Management System (EMS). It MUST contain one of the following values: 

<table style="min-width:100%;width:100%">
<tr>
    <th style="width:25%;">Code</th>
    <th style="width:25%;">Display</th>
    <th style="width:50%;">Definition</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">success</code></td>
      <td>Success</td>
    <td>The request was processed successfully</td>
 </tr>
<tr>
    <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">data-requested</code></td>
      <td>Data Requested</td>
    <td>The request was processed successfully, but more data may result in a more complete evaluation</td>
 </tr>
<tr>
    <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">data-required</code></td>
      <td>Data Required</td>
    <td>The request was processed, but more data is required to complete the evaluation</td>
 </tr>
<tr>
    <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">failure</code></td>
      <td>Failure</td>
    <td>The request was not processed successfully</td>
 </tr>
</table>


The status should be set to 'success' when the result is ready.  
This means that the CDSS has all information possible (for this SD), and has provided a result.
GuidanceResponse.result must be populated with at least one of ReferralRequest, TriggerDefinition or whatever we decide on for home care
 
If more information is needed, the status must be 'data-required'.
